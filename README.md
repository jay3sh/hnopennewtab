This is a simple Chrome extension that modifies the news links on Hacker News page so that when you click on them they will open in new tab. This is a minor convenience, because the same effect can be achieved by middle-click or alt+mouse click or right click > Open in new tab. But these options are not available when I'm reading Hacker News while having lunch and don't have a mouse around.

If you have the same problem, you can use this extension.

Git clone this repo
Goto chrome://extensions
Click on "Load unpacked extension"
Select the direction of this extension

Voila!
